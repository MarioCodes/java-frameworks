# Spring in Action, by Craig Walls  
Following book and implementing code examples.

* **Chapter 2.** Developing web applications  
MVC; Thymeleaf; Controllers;

* **Chapter 3.** Working with data   
Databases; JDBC vs Spring Data JPA;  
The examples at this chapter **do not** work! The examples from the author are a mess, don't work and following the book *step by step*, there's code that magically appears / disappears at it's repository. I'm not gonna spend more hours fixing something the author should've done.
